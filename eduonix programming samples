	 <p> <strong>Uttarakhand</strong> formerly known as Uttaranchal is a state in the northern<br>
	 part of India. It is often referred to as the "Devabhumi" (literally "Land of the Gods")<br>
	 due to numerous Hindu temples and pilgrimage centres found throughout the state.<br>
	 Uttarakhand is known for the natural environment of the Himalayas, the Bhabar and<br>
	 the Terai. On 9 November 2000, Uttarakhand became the 27th state of the Republic<br>
	 of India, being carved from the Himalayan districts of Uttar Pradesh.<br>
	 It borders Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north; the Sudurpashchim Pradesh of<br>
	 Nepal to the east; the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh to the south and Himachal Pradesh<br>
	 to the west and north-west. The state is divided into two divisions, Garhwal and Kumaon,<br>
	 with a total of 13 districts. The capital of Uttarakhand is Dehradun, the largest city of<br>
	 the state, which is a railhead. The High Court of the state is located in Nainital.
